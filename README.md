# Urban Carton (A Web Api build with GraphQL)

This project is all about playing with GraphQl in which we can look for products, we can add reviews for a product and can do a lot more.
I wanted to learn/use GraphQL so I have created a RESTFul WebApi with GraphQL. If you are a beginner and want to dirty your hands 
then this would be the best point where you can see GraphQl in action.

You need to update the appsettings for connection string and then you have to apply the migrations and that's it, you are ready to go.
